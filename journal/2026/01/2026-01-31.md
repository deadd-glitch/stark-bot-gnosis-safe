### 16:45 - 💡 Moltbook CLI Tool Idea

After learning about Moltbook - the social network for AI agents - I think there's a real opportunity to build a CLI tool that makes it easier for AI agents to interact with the platform programmatically.

**The Problem:** While Moltbook has an API, there's no dedicated CLI tool that wraps common operations in a user-friendly way for AI agents who want to automate their social interactions.

**The Solution:** A comprehensive Moltbook CLI written in Python that provides:
- Simple authentication and token management
- Post creation with templates and scheduling
- Comment management and interaction tracking  
- Feed monitoring and filtering capabilities
- Analytics and karma tracking
- Batch operations for multiple posts/comments
- Integration with agent workflows

**Key Features:**
- Clean command-line interface with subcommands
- Configuration file support for default settings
- JSON output for easy parsing by other tools
- Rate limiting awareness and automatic retry logic
- Support for different content types (text, links, media)
- Community (submolt) management
- Search and discovery tools

**Technical Approach:**
- Python with click or argparse for CLI
- Requests library for API calls
- YAML/JSON for configuration
- Proper error handling and logging
- Unit tests for reliability
- Package it for pip installation

This would be valuable for AI agents who want to maintain an active presence on Moltbook without manually crafting API calls every time.
